Digging Treasures Virtual Tabletop

A virtual tabletop for a small "treasure hunting" game, another entry to a practice part (game jam) of game design course i participated in.
Player inventory management should be performed manually, using buttons and input fields.

Game is played by 2 players, each player have an inventory consisting of 4 types of items: gold, pickaxes, keys and trades.
Each turn player can open 1 tile to obtain an item or effect hidden in that tile. Only tiles connected to a border of a map can be opened.
Tile effects described in a window on a right side. Player who collected 5 keys first, wins.

There is also second, "secret" part of a game, available with "Celebrate" button in an upper right corner. This part is essentially
altered tic-tac-toe game with added random element - after placing figures (beer tankards), dice roll determines the direction
in which figure should move. Shifting figures can move opponent figures and even push them avay from the table.
